# Predictive-Modeling-
The data set chosen for this assignment is the Billionaires data. Each model was created to predict the target variable, worth in billions. The goal in developing more than one model was to improve upon the predictive strength from model one to model four.  This is the data: https://github.com/melissaEYE/Predictive-Modeling-/blob/main/billionaires.csv

Visualizations, via COGNOS Analytics, of varying types are used to "tell the story" of the data. Report is found here: https://github.com/melissaEYE/Predictive-Modeling-/blob/main/Assignment3_Melissa_Hunfalvay.docx
